			`I live in Houston Texas, and trying to make it my stomping grounds for raising a family and enhancing my skills in life.
			 I've worked on a variety of Teams as a consultant. over the years and I'm proud of the progress I've made. and wanted to get better at software deveopment.
			 Ive focused on slowly and steadily honing in on areas of new technology to grow my understanding for the future, and react was one of them so I decided to want to become a full stack developer.
			 outside of my professional career I enjoy playing sports, you can find me playing Volleyball and pickleball on the weekends(if my wife lets me lol).
